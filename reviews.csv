1. The renovation of the enclosures are still ongoing, BUT the staff didn't disturb the animals on the display so the animals aren't too annoyed with the presence of the humans.
2. Animals in the zoo look healthy. Mom played with her young, animal greeted the human, snakes are sleeping soundly in the cages that are fit for their size, crocs are sunbathing, the bears are playing with their cagemate, big cats are taking nap, birds walking around the aviary... So happy to see them yesterday.

We went hiking in late morning weekday and its super quiet. Nice and quaint.
Love the pine tree forest. Paths are super sandy it coated my hiking shoes orange brown. 
Took just 30min to slowly walk up to the beautiful view point. Air was so cooling and view was therapeutic. Coming down was only 20min slow walk. Totalling up to only 2.5km.
Thus the trail is easy but wears shoes with good grip because the path is sandy and can be slippery if your running shoes have poor grip.
